		"Summary": "Welcome to one of the most incredible best-kept secrets in South America, Tarapoto Peru. This gorgeous city in the Amazon, which boasts the most diverse species bird species on earth, is filled with lagoons, palms, and wildlife while also being able to provide all the VIP comforts for our guests to enjoy their first class stay",
		"Description": "After our private chauffeur picks you up from the airport we welcome you to your private air-conditioned lodge with a welcome box with sweets, fruit and a locally made bottle of spirits. After a while to settle yourselves we take you out for dinner at one of the best Restaurants in Tarapoto for a custom three-course meal featuring Jungle cuisine. In the morning after a big breakfast of native fruits, bread and juices we take you to soak up the sun at the blue lagoon. After a few laid back hours there we bring you to a local spot for lunch that specializes in grilled fish. After this, we bring you to Tambo Illusion, a nature park with a professional English speaking guide who will explain to you about the local nature and species of animals you can see. After exploring this enchanting paradise we bring you back to your hotels to rest and change clothes before dinner. Weâ€™ll then take you to one of the nicer lounges or bars, La Alternativa, to relax and enjoy a few drinks before taking you to Natural, one of if not the best gourmet restaurants in Tarapoto for an exclusive tasting menu. We then escort you back to your suite for a well deserved night sleep. Then in the morning we pack your bags for you in our SUV and drive to get a big jungle breakfast before bringing you to the airport."
